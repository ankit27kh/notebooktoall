# NotebookToAll
The coolest way to turn a Jupyter Notebook into sharable files.

Turn your Jupyter Notebook into a .py executable file and an .html file with a one-line command. You can create both or either file type at the same time! Under the hood, this package uses Jupyter nbconvert.

nbconvert is great for command line transformations, but it takes a bit of work to use in a program. NotebookToAll to the rescue!

# Quick Start

## Install
Install from PyPI.

`pip install notebooktoall`

## Use

```
from notebooktoall.transform import transform_notebook

transform_notebook(ipynb_file="my_jupyter_notebook.ipynb", export_list=["html", "py"])
```

Run your code and an .html file and an executable .py file will appear in your current working directory. Use and share!

Ensure your Jupyter notebook doesn't have magic commands in it if you want to create an executable .py script.

You can also pass the URL of a Jupyter notebook to transform_notebook().
